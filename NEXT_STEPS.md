# Next Steps - Database Seeding Pipeline Setup

## ✅ Completed Migration
Your repository has been successfully migrated to:
**https://github.com/TendaniSadiki/k53simulationapp**

All branches and tags have been pushed to your new repository.

## 🔧 Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Configure GitHub Secrets
Go to your repository → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions

Add these required secrets:

| Secret Name | Description | How to Get |
|-------------|-------------|------------|
| `SUPABASE_URL` | Your Supabase project URL | From Supabase dashboard |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | Service role key (bypasses RLS) | From Supabase Settings → API |

### 2. Test the Database Seeding Pipeline

1. **Go to Actions**: https://github.com/TendaniSadiki/k53simulationapp/actions
2. **Select "Database Seeding Pipeline"**
3. **Click "Run workflow"**
4. **Select branch**: `developer` or `main`
5. **Click "Run workflow"**

### 3. Verify Successful Run
Check that the workflow:
- ✅ Completes without errors
- ✅ Shows "Database seeded successfully" message
- ✅ Reports 80 questions inserted (66 Rules of Road + 14 Vehicle Controls)

## 🛡️ Recommended Setup

### Branch Protection (Optional but Recommended)
Enable branch protection for main branches:
- Require pull request reviews before merging
- Require status checks to pass
- Prevent force pushes

### Environment Variables
Update your local `.env` file with the same values as GitHub secrets for local testing.

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### If workflow fails due to billing:
- The workflow is configured for free tier usage
- It only runs on manual trigger (`workflow_dispatch`)
- No automatic runs that might use paid minutes

### Database Connection Issues:
- Verify Supabase URL is correct
- Check service role key has proper permissions
- Ensure database tables exist (`questions` table)

### Local Testing:
```bash
# Test seeding locally first
dart run scripts/seed_evolve_academy_final.dart
```

## 📊 Expected Results

After successful pipeline run:
- Database should contain 80 Evolve Academy questions
- Questions categorized as Rules of Road and Vehicle Controls
- Proper learner codes (1, 2, 3) for different vehicle types
- All questions with explanations and difficulty levels

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check workflow logs for specific error messages
2. Verify Supabase credentials are correct
3. Ensure database schema matches expected structure
4. Test seeding locally first to isolate issues

## 🎯 Success Metrics
- Pipeline runs successfully on manual trigger
- 80 questions inserted into database
- No errors in workflow logs
- Database ready for app usage

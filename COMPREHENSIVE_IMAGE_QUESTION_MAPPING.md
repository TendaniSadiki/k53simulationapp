## Implementation Strategy

1. **Systematic Assignment**: Assign images based on question content and sign category
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with road_signs category, then expand to rules_of_road
3. **Verification**: Use the existing `verify_image_paths.dart` script to ensure all paths are valid
4. **Database Update**: Update both SQL and Dart question databases with appropriate image_url fields

## Next Steps

1. Create specific question-image pairings for each category
2. Update the question database with appropriate image references
3. Verify all image paths work correctly
4. Test the enhanced question database functionality

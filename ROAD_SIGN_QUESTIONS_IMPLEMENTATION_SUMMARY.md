# Road Sign Questions Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully created a comprehensive set of 19 road sign-specific questions for the K53 driving test application. These questions focus specifically on road sign recognition and interpretation, using only descriptive image names from the `assets/individual_signs/` directory while avoiding `sign_page_` prefixed images.

## Files Created

### 1. Dart Generator Script
- **File**: [`scripts/seed_road_sign_questions.dart`](scripts/seed_road_sign_questions.dart:1)
- **Purpose**: Generates SQL insert statements for road sign questions
- **Features**: 
  - Programmatic question creation with proper JSON formatting
  - Automatic SQL file generation
  - Easy maintenance and future expansion

### 2. SQL Output File
- **File**: [`scripts/road_sign_questions_output.sql`](scripts/road_sign_questions_output.sql:1)
- **Purpose**: Ready-to-execute SQL script for inserting road sign questions
- **Content**: 19 questions covering various road sign categories

## Question Categories

### Regulatory Signs (5 questions)
- Speed limit signs
- Overtaking prohibitions  
- Yield signs
- No stopping signs
- Goods vehicle restrictions

### Informational Signs (4 questions)
- Residential area signs
- Paid parking signs
- Time-restricted parking
- Disability parking reservations

### Prohibition Signs (3 questions)
- General overtaking prohibitions
- No entry signs
- Vehicle-specific restrictions

### Command Signs (2 questions)
- Stop signs
- Directional movement signs

### Warning Signs (2 questions)
- Roundabout warnings
- Pedestrian crossing warnings

### Freeway Signs (2 questions)
- Freeway beginning signs
- Freeway end signs

### Mass/Dimension Signs (1 question)
- Gross vehicle mass limits

## Image Integration

All questions use descriptive image names from the `assets/individual_signs/` directory:
- `Maximum speed limit allowed.png`
- `Overtaking prohibited for the next 2km.png`
- `Indicates that you must yield to other traffic. Gi.png`
- `No stopping to ensure traffic flow and prevent dri.png`
- And 15 other descriptive image names

## Usage Instructions

1. **Run the SQL script** in Supabase SQL Editor:
   ```sql
   \i scripts/road_sign_questions_output.sql
   ```

2. **Verify insertion** by checking the result message

3. **Questions will be available** in the `road_signs` category for all learner codes

## Technical Details

- **Database Schema**: Uses existing `questions` table with `image_url` column
- **JSON Format**: Properly formatted options array for each question
- **Difficulty Levels**: All questions set to difficulty level 1 (basic recognition)
- **Category**: All questions categorized under `road_signs` for easy filtering

## Future Expansion

The Dart script can be easily modified to:
- Add more road sign questions
- Update existing questions
- Modify difficulty levels
- Add additional categories
- Support different learner code requirements

## Verification

All image paths have been verified to exist in the assets directory using the [`scripts/verify_image_paths.dart`](scripts/verify_image_paths.dart:1) script.
